        <p class="lightBody" id="content1">Murray Gell-Mann is best known for his pre-eminent
            role in the discovery and conceptualisation of elementary particles.
            Elementary particles (coined as “Quarks” by Gell-Mann) are the fundamental
            building blocks of the subatomic particles that we know of. Along with this
            discovery, Gell-Mann played a key role in developing the concept of chirality
            in weak nuclear interactions.</p>
